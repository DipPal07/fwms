      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p><b>Welcome to Food Waste Management System</b></p>
      <p>
        Food waste refers to the decrease in the quantity or quality of food
        resulting from decisions and actions by retailers, food service
        providers and consumers. Food is wasted in many ways:
      </p>
      <ul style="text-align: left">
        <li>
          Fresh produce that deviates from what is considered optimal, for
          example in terms of shape, size and color, is often removed from the
          supply chain during sorting operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Foods that are close to, at or beyond the "best-before" date are often
          discarded by retailers and consumers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Large quantities of wholesome edible food are often unused or left
          over and discarded from household kitchens and eating establishments.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Less food loss and waste would lead to more efficient land use and
        better water resource management with positive impacts on climate change
        and livelihoods.
