      <h1>Welcome to Food Waste Management System</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Food waste</b> refers to the decrease in the quantity or quality of
        food resulting from decisions and actions by retailers, food service
        providers and consumers. Food is wasted in many ways:
      </p>
      <ul style="text-align: left">
        <li>
          Fresh produce that deviates from what is considered optimal, for
          example in terms of shape, size and color, is often removed from the
          supply chain during sorting operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Foods that are close to, at or beyond the "best-before" date are often
          discarded by retailers and consumers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Large quantities of wholesome edible food are often unused or left
          over and discarded from household kitchens and eating establishments.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Less food loss and waste would lead to more efficient land use and
        better water resource management with positive impacts on climate change
        and livelihoods.
