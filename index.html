    <h1>Welcome to Food Waste Management System</h1>
    <p>
      Food waste refers to the decrease in the quantity or quality of food due to decisions and actions by retailers, food service providers, and consumers. It happens in various ways:
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li>
        Fresh produce that doesn't meet optimal standards in shape, size, or color is often discarded.
      </li>
      <li>
        Foods near or past the "best-before" date are frequently thrown away.
      </li>
      <li>
        Large amounts of edible food are left unused or discarded from households and eateries.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Reducing food waste leads to more efficient land use, better water resource management, and positive impacts on climate change and livelihoods. Join us in our mission to minimize food waste and create a sustainable future.
