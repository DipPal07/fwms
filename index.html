    <h1>Welcome to Food Waste Management System</h1>
    <p>
      Food waste refers to the decrease in the quantity or quality of food
      resulting from decisions and actions by retailers, food service providers
      and consumers. Food is wasted in many ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fresh produce that deviates from what is considered optimal, for example
        in terms of shape, size and color, is often removed from the supply
        chain during sorting operations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Foods that are close to, at or beyond the "best-before" date are often
        discarded by retailers and consumers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Large quantities of wholesome edible food are often unused or left over
        and discarded from household kitchens and eating establishments.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Less food loss and waste would lead to more efficient land use and better
      water resource management with positive impacts on climate change and
      livelihoods.
