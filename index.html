        <p>
          Food wastage is a growing concern, with millions of tons of food being
          discarded every year while countless people go hungry. Our Food Waste
          Management System aims to bridge this gap by connecting food donors
          with those in need. However, to make this vision a reality, we need
          your support.

      <p>
        <b>Food waste</b> refers to the decrease in the quantity or quality of
        food resulting from decisions and actions by retailers, food service
        providers and consumers. Food is wasted in many ways:
      </p>
      <ul style="text-align: left">
        <li>
          Fresh produce that deviates from what is considered optimal, for
          example in terms of shape, size and color, is often removed from the
          supply chain during sorting operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Foods that are close to, at or beyond the "best-before" date are often
          discarded by retailers and consumers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Large quantities of wholesome edible food are often unused or left
          over and discarded from household kitchens and eating establishments.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Less food loss and waste would lead to more efficient land use and
        better water resource management with positive impacts on climate change
        and livelihoods.
